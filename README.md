# Introduction 
Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company), led by Sudhanshu Tomar, emerges as a prominent computer hardware manufacturer in India,

Nevertheless, the management has identified a need for enhanced data-driven decision-making capabilities. To address this, they aim to bolster their data analytics
team by recruiting multiple junior data analysts. Sudhanshu Tomar, the director of data analytics, seeks an individual proficient in technical expertise 
and interpersonal abilities. Consequently, he plans to organize a SQL challenge as a means to assess proficiency in both areas.
